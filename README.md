# Steven's Dotfiles

These the dotfiles I've changed to change my [prompt](#prompt), added a few [aliases](aliases) and edited my [welcome message](#welcome-message)

## Aliases

I've added two aliases for the two most frequented locations on my pc: One for documents being ``cddoc`` and one for my Dropbox folder being ``cddb``

```sh
alias cddoc='cd ~/../mnt/c/Users/Steven/Documents' alias cddb='cd ~/../mnt/c/Users/Steven/Dropbox'
```

## Prompt

I've edited my prompt to a simple line:

```sh 
[Steven@\W] 
```

I left the other syntax in place as I'm sure it's important. I've wrapped the entire prompt in ``[brackets]`` to seperate my commands from the prompt.

I've tried adding an emoji but for some reason Cmder wouldn't show it. Most cases of instructions I found were using the OS X emoji keyboard to add one (I'm on Windows). I've tried copying one online but it wouldn't show.

## Welcome message

![My message](https://i.imgur.com/5DrBFU8.png)

I've added both ``cowsay`` and ``fortune``, but I found ``fortune`` to be a little too deep and philosophical so I made a message for myself.

Unfortunately, the cow does appear to have some serious leg problems. I'm not sure what caused it but it seems to be content with its life. Any feedback on how to fix this poor creature would be appreciated.
